        "model_answer": "title: Prompt neutrino flux in the atmosphere revisited abstract: a model of neutrino flux produced in the early universe is proposed to describe the atmospheric muon flux rising anywhere from supernova to a supernova. such neutrinos flux model, to some degree, can be utilized to determine the intensity of majorana neutrinos produced in the early universe, or to estimate underground flux of neutrinos. this scenario naturally translates into an atmospheric neutrino flux that decays largely to neutrinos if the surrounding atmospheric neutrinos are detectable. it has been shown that this cascade might undergo two effects despite of the matching of background elastic inside the source, namely annihilation of mediators off nuclei. in ongoing experiments, a coupling of the aforementioned symmetry enhances the flux of atmospheric muons. this behavior has been examined by using qed - coprot data rather than microwave observations of the cosmic microwave background. in addition resulting in an @xmath0 suppression of the astrophysical background output, an alternative possibility is to search for a space combining these two effects : a neutrino flux above threshold but with no extra contributions. this is apparently a very useful approach for constraining the range of parameters for large underground neutrino events, not only for their width and significance but also for their timings. most current theoretical analyses could be extended to such wide ranges leading to its predictions, i.e. an astrophysical contribution only weakly due to cascade processes and the important interference of parameters. the net contribution of the quadrupole and cascade extrapolating current - induced cascades is also briefly discussed."
